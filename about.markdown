I'm a learning designer and graduate student in Human-Computer interaction specializing in educational technology. I strive to employ evidence-based instructional techniques to build online courses for adult learners.

With a background in learning design and project management, I'm uniquely positioned to work alongside content experts and developers to create effective educational resources for online courses in academic and professional contexts.

Years of experience working as an instructional designer, learning developer, and project manager at multilateral organizations have given me a unique perspective on the best technical, pedagogical, and managerial approaches to adopt when creating computer-based training for diverse audiences worldwide.

My approach to learning design is rooted in educational technology and learning sciences. Moving forward, I am excited to combine my work background with my academic experience to take a systematic approach to course creation, implementation, and evaluation by employing research methods and tools for visual analytics to guide the course team across the product cycle.
