I am a learning designer with a background in project management. I am a Human-Computer Interaction graduate student at the Rochester Institute of Technology specializing in Instructional Systems Design (ISD).

I am skilled in creating engaging and effective online learning experiences. I have designed accessible online learning modules using modern authoring tools and learning management systems.

After completing all my MS-HCI core classes, I am excited to apply my newly developed skills in usability testing and user research to online courses. I am also interested in using visual analytics tools to explore online course data.
