As a graduate student in the MS-HCI program at RIT, specializing in educational technology. I am uniquely positioned to create engaging and effective online learning experiences. I have successfully designed accessible (WCAG-compliant) self-paced e-learning modules with modern authoring tools and learning management systems. I have experience working under the ADDIE model, SAM Agile and Rapid Prototyping. In my role as a learning designer and program officer, I have also demonstrated strong project management skills.

Additionally, I am proficient with Adobe Creative Suite, Figma/Adobe XD, and Articulate 360. Moving forward, I am excited to expand my skill set to include usability testing and user research, particularly in the area of learning platforms and modules. I am also interested in using visual analytics tools to explore online course data.
