Technology has been a driving force for the economic growth of the global south. In countries like India, with a thriving technology industry and consumer base, the social and economic transformation that technology has brought is significant. Historically, Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) has focused on a few regions, principally Asia and Africa. This makes evident the need to expand its geographical reach in the global south, and to "include underserved communities in the US and Europe" [[1]](#1-reference).

The challenges HCI4D aims to tackle are well aligned with the United Nation's framework for sustainable development [[3]](#3-reference). The definition of development can take many forms depending on the time in history and the discipline that defines it. From the perspective of economics, its meaning has evolved from pure growth of gross national product (GNP) to "a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy". As explained by Amartya Sen, "development requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom: poverty as well as tyranny, poor economic opportunities as well as systematic social deprivation, neglect of public facilities as well as intolerance or overactivity of repressive states" [[5]](#5-reference). This demands from HCI4D research and practice a focus on outputs and outcomes; after all, many consider HCI4D is "for development outputs as much as it is for development outcomes" [[1]](#1-reference). In my view, HCI4D research should ask questions about the intended and unintended effects that a particular technology can or may have on the lives of target users. This includes exploring how a particular product or service has contributed to users' well-being in the short and long term. It would also be interesting to look at how the adoption of a particular technology may contribute to expanding users' freedoms.

In the last couple of decades, HCI4D researchers and practitioners have made substantial contributions to application domains such as education, access and health [[1]](#1-reference). The progress seen in the access domain, especially in Asia, has been unprecedented. Dell et al. noted how widespread access to low-cost mobile computing has motivated researchers to move from a focus on creating specialized hardware "designed specifically for low-resource settings, such as the One Laptop per Child project" to an emphasis on analyzing the socio-technical transformations of mobile computing [[1]](#1-reference). Furthermore, the outcomes that may come from the implementation of IT and HCI interventions in under-served and under-resourced contexts can only be truly unveiled by conducting qualitative research. In my opinion, qualitative research allows for a context aware evaluation of technology as it is used by users. Kumar [[6]](#6-reference) have contributed to HCI4D research literature with their ethnographic and qualitative inquiries in India. By observing how "leisure-driven engagement with new media, [...], and the development-friendly outcomes that result from it" [[6]](#6-reference), they have unveiled the ways in which users modify their behaviour or adapt habits to fit the technology into their lives. They also show the unexpected tensions that may arrise between the social values embedded in a technology, like the social media platform, Facebook (FB) and the social values of the place where it comes to operate. It is thorough contextual inquiry and unstructured interviews that Kumar discovers how FB contributes to "generating, fulfilling, sustaining, and raising" user's aspirations [[4]](#4-reference).
