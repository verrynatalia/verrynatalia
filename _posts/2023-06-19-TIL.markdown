When scanning handmade watermarks with Scanner Utility, select 1,200 dpi and TIFF format for better image quality. If the marks are black, set Black & White for kind, as it helps reduce image size.

After opening the scan in Adobe Photoshop, adjust the image resolution to 300 dpi by constraining the aspect ratio, then copy the image width. Type 300 Pixes/Inch and paste the original width.
