The course [Taking action to achieve disability-inclusive WASH](https://agora.unicef.org/course/info.php?id=40281) is a self-paced training developed by WaterAid, UNICEF, and the World Bank Group. Its aim is to raise awareness and provide information to staff and partners working in low and middle-income countries regarding disability-inclusive WASH projects. The course is divided into seven modules, each approximately 15 minutes in length. The modules are as follows:

1. Disability-inclusive WASH
2. Meaningful participation of persons with disabilities
3. Identifying and tackling barriers faced by persons with disabilities
4. Accessibility to WASH services and supplies
5. Empowerment and capacities development of the persons with disabilities
6. Disability data collection and analysis
7. Reflecting and taking action on disability-inclusive WASH

The course is accessible through UNICEF's learning platform Agora.

#### Learning Design

- Content: All content modules follow a similar structure to facilitate learners' navigation, including a welcome message, navigation help, glossary, lessons (with articles, videos, knowledge checks, case studies, etc.), takeaways, additional resources, and a quiz.
- Quiz: At the end of each module, a short quiz with unlimited attempts and instant feedback will be presented to help participants self-assess their knowledge and understanding of the topics. The questions will be in a multiple-choice format and provide feedback on wrong answers. The minimum passing score is 80%.
- Resources: Additional documents and links to resources will be hosted on the course page to ensure quality assurance.
- Personalized learning: Given that the course will be open to a broad audience with varying levels of knowledge, participants can navigate and complete it in the order they prefer. All quizzes will allow unlimited attempts and have an 80% passing mark.
- Accessibility: Special design and technical considerations were taken into account to ensure compliance with W3C accessibility standards. A navigation help section and [additional instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DIAjt5iZ455l0UML9-Bo6GCNYoMk0gou/view?usp=sharing) on how to navigate the module using screen readers were provided.

#### Visual design
- Look and feel: The design of the modules will adhere to UNICEF brand guidelines. A prototype showcasing the branding and module structure was provided to exemplify the visual treatment and navigation flow of the modules.
- Other media: Videos, animations, and other graphic elements will be incorporated throughout the modules. UNICEF, WaterAid, and the World Bank provided all the materials except for interactive figures, which I developed in consultation with SMEs using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.
