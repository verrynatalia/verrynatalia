According to Mayo Clinic, “total or significant loss of hearing is usually the result of inner ear or nerve damage”. The causes of hearing loss are multiple, they can be “congenital defect, injury, disease, certain medications, exposure to loud noise, or age-related wear and tear” [[1]](#1-reference). The effects of such a condition are the inability to hear sound. This negatively affects a person’s ability to communicate and interact with others. For youth in particular, hearing loss may put them at risk of abuse and neglect. Sadly, individuals living in poverty are more at risk of suffering from hearing loss. A study with 105 thousand of children in Scotland found that the rate of children born with hearing loss is significantly higher among poor than wealthy families. The study reported a “clear correlation” between poverty and congenital hearing loss [[2]](#2-reference). Reasons for this correlation could be a lack of access to preventive health care and treatment. Conditions like middle ear infections, lead poisoning, and malnutrition may be additional causes of hearing loss in children [[3]](#3-reference). Hearing loss in children and youth from a low-resource economic background can have a negative impact on their mental development, as well as negative consequences on their social-emotional and academic performance which will affect their capacity of being productive later in life.

Hearing loss is a condition that will have long-term effects on the life of individuals. Therefore, local governments, NGOs, charitable organizations and civil society should work on public health programs that target children and youth. The most common causes of hearing loss are well known and some of them are preventable. Providing access to regular and preventable ear care is one measure that may reduce children and youth’s risk of developing ear loss. Malnutrition also plays a part in hearing loss, thus public food programs should respond with comprehensive nutrition plans to ensure children and youth are eating the nutrients they need to grow up healthy.

According to the United States Census Bureau, “children in poverty were more likely to have a disability than children above the poverty threshold in 2008 and 2019”. Measures to improve outcomes for children and youth in New York State need to target communities that are more affected.

This data analysis aims to explore the reported correlation between poverty and hearing disability prevalence in New York State. It also aims to find counties where the prevalence of hearing loss in youth is higher, that to inform health and nutrition interventions led by public officials and civil society.

Poverty and hearing conditions in youth

*Unimodal distribution*

The distributions of poverty and hearing disabilities in youth are both skewed to the right (see figure 1 and figure 2).

##### Figure 2. Distribution of poverty in NYS youth. (mean=738, median=672, StdDev=454.5)

*Thematic maps*

The below maps use graduated color symbology to differentiate areas (counties and cities) more affected by poverty (see figure 3) and hearing loss (see figure 4). The results of such thematic maps show striking similarities in the distribution of both conditions, indicating a possible correlation between the two.

*Summarize Within*

To continue the exploration I used the Summarize Within tool to create a thematic map that relates youth poverty and youth hearing loss. I also added summary fields like poverty female (sum, mean, and SD), poverty male (sum, mean, and SD), and kilometers as shape units (figure 5).

Scatterplot
The below scatterplot makes clear a symmetric correlation between poverty and hearing in youth (see figure 7). Among the counties, more affected by both conditions are Orange County; Kings County, and Queens. Public health programs should start by targeting those counties on the right side of the plot. By doing so they may be able to improve children and youth outcomes.

*Orange county youth poverty/hearing density*

The map below shows poverty and hearing loss in youth in one of the counties more affected by both conditions (see figure 9). Additional information is provided in the table below regarding the state of male, female, and elderly populations (see table 1).
