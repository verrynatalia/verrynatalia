The self-paced online training course on disability-inclusive WASH is a joint product of WaterAid, UNICEF, and the World Bank Group. It is being hosted on UNICEF's online learning platform and is based on an existing 6-month online course developed by WaterAid.

The new version of the course has been transformed into seven self-paced modules, each approximately 15 minutes in length. The table below provides a comparison of the modules and their lengths between the versions.

#### Learning Design

With the aim of increasing staff and partners' capacity to carry out inclusive and empowering water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) work, the [Taking action to achieve inclusive WASH](https://learninghub.wateraid.org/course/view.php?id=214) 6-month course was transformed into the 90-minute course [Taking action to achieve disability-inclusive WASH](https://agora.unicef.org/course/info.php?id=40281). We follow the high-level process depicted in the figure below.

The storyboard/scripts of the 'Taking Action to Achieve Inclusive WASH' course were recreated in MS Word format. The storyboards/scripts served as the basis for adapting/developing the content of the new modules. Subject matter experts (SMEs), especially SMEs, worked closely with me to revise the content. I created a [work plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14e8Ke_t4zeNaIWjWBEbeddBH6aobC5Na/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107391323571094635235&rtpof=true&sd=true) with milestones and deadlines to facilitate our progress. Throughout the modules, learners will find media and interactive elements, as well as knowledge checks with automatic feedback. Additionally, the following considerations were taken into account when working on this course:
- Content: All content modules follow a similar structure to facilitate learners' navigation, including a welcome message, navigation help, glossary, lessons (with articles, videos, knowledge checks, case studies, etc.), takeaways, additional resources, and a quiz.
- Quiz: At the end of each module, a short quiz with unlimited attempts and instant feedback will be presented to help participants self-assess their knowledge and understanding of the topics. The questions will be in a multiple-choice format and provide feedback on wrong answers. The minimum passing score is 80%.
- Resources: Additional documents and links to resources will be hosted on the course page to ensure quality assurance.
- Personalized learning: Given that the course will be open to a broad audience with varying levels of knowledge, participants can navigate and complete it in the order they prefer. All quizzes will allow unlimited attempts and have an 80% passing mark.
- Accessibility: Special design and technical considerations were taken into account to ensure compliance with W3C accessibility standards. A navigation help section and [additional instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DIAjt5iZ455l0UML9-Bo6GCNYoMk0gou/view?usp=sharing) on how to navigate the module using screen readers were provided.

#### Visual design
- Look and feel: The design of the modules will adhere to UNICEF brand guidelines. A prototype showcasing the branding and module structure was provided to exemplify the visual treatment and navigation flow of the modules.
- Other media: Videos, animations, and other graphic elements will be incorporated throughout the modules. UNICEF, WaterAid, and the World Bank provided all the materials except for interactive figures, which I developed in consultation with SMEs using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.

#### Technical specification

- Output: SCORM 1.2, HTML5 compliant.
- Authoring tool: The modules will be developed using template blocks from Articulate Rise 360. This authoring tool, used for designing and developing modules, offers content block templates (both static and interactive). For the complete list, please refer to [this link](https://articulate.com/support/article/Rise-Lesson-and-Block-Types).
- Hosting: The modules in SCORM 1.2 format will be hosted on UNICEF's learning management system.
- Delivery services: The modules will adapt to different screen sizes to facilitate navigation on smartphones and tablets.
- Compatibility: The SCORM packages are compatible with Totara and Moodle platforms.
- Publishing settings: The modules will be published in SCORM 1.2 format. They will allow multiple attempts and save the participants' progress and completion status (complete/incomplete).
- Progress Marking: Participants can complete modules at their own pace, and the platform will automatically save their progress.
