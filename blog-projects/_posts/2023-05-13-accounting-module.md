Creating an interactive module to teach a procedure at the "use level" was a project assignment for the Interactive Courseware class in my master's in Human-Computer Interaction.

This tutorial shows learners how to record business transactions correctly. Recording transactions is a branching procedure divided into four steps. It involves working with resources such as the Balance Sheet Account, Income Statement Account, accounting journal, and ledger. This tutorial is not about learning how to use software to complete the procedure. Instead, it will show the “bookkeeping” process in its most basic form to teach the rules and principles that apply in all cases.

The audience is novice learners who are new to accounting. The content was adapted
from a college-level Introduction to Accounting course for students in business
administration and finance majors.

The instructional objectives of this tutorial are

* From memory, the learner should be able to recall all the steps involved in
recording a transaction.
* Given a transaction, the learner should be able to record the transaction in the accounting ledger correctly.

This tutorial assumes learners’ familiarity with basic accounting concepts such as the accounting equation, account types, and the two main rules in accounting.
Learners will find a welcome message and the learning objectives. Then a brief
introduction will set the stage for the procedure, which is consequently presented as a list. After the procedure is shown, learners will find a demonstration video of how to record business transactions. Lastly, learners will find exercises that will ask them to determine if a given summary procedure is correct. They will also have to answer multiple-choice questions about recording new transactions in the journal and ledger.
