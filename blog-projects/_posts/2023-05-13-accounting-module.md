The tutorial [Recording business transactions](https://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=bbbc94bf-78c9-492b-8db9-7e6b51d59035) was created for the Interactive Courseware class in the Master's in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the spring of 2023.

The tutorial aims to teach college students in business administration and finance majors who are taking an Introduction to Accounting class how to record business transactions.

The standard procedure consists of four steps and requires working with resources such as the Balance Sheet Account, Income Statement Account, accounting journal, and ledger. The tutorial includes work examples that explain the step-by-step process of recording transactions in various business scenarios.
