This is a class assignment in the Interactive Courseware class taught by Mrs. Katie Sabourin in the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the Spring of 2023. The assignment was to create an interactive module to teach a procedure at the "use level".

This tutorial aims to guide learners on correctly recording business transactions. The process of recording transactions is a branching procedure consisting of four steps. It involves working with resources such as the Balance Sheet Account, Income Statement Account, accounting journal, and ledger. 

The tutorial’s focus is not on teaching how to use software for completing the procedure but rather on illustrating the fundamental “bookkeeping” process to teach the rules and principles that apply universally.

The target audience for this tutorial is novice learners who are new to accounting. The content was adapted from a college-level Introduction to Accounting course designed for students majoring in business administration and finance.

The instructional objectives of this tutorial are as follows:

* From memory, the learner should be able to recall all the steps involved in recording a transaction.
* Given a transaction, the learner should be able to correctly record the transaction in the accounting ledger.

This tutorial assumes learners’ familiarity with basic accounting concepts such as the accounting equation, account types, and the two main rules in accounting. Upon accessing the tutorial, learners will encounter a welcome message and learning objectives. A brief introduction will provide an overview of the procedure, followed by a step-by-step presentation. Subsequently, learners will find a demonstration video illustrating how to record business transactions. Finally, learners will be presented with exercises that assess their ability to determine the correctness of a given summary procedure. They will also be asked to answer multiple-choice questions related to recording new transactions in the journal and ledger.
