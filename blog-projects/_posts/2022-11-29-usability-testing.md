The usability evaluation of RIT's website was a group assignment for the project-based Usability Testing class in the Master's in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the spring of 2022. Our client was the Division of Marketing and Communication at RIT, who wanted us to test the usability of RIT's main website. The figure above describes the milestones of the project.

**Goals and Research Questions**

The usability evaluation aimed to identify any issues with the website's navigation or content, specifically from the perspective of prospective college students. We formulated the following research questions:

- Can participants successfully complete the tasks assigned to them during the testing session?
- How easy is it for participants to perform the tasks, and how satisfied are they upon completion of each task?
- Do users navigate the site using the search function or the navigation bar to find information?

**Participants**

The participants in this usability evaluation were prospective college students and first-year college students acting as surrogate participants. We worked with a total of six participants, including one high school senior student and five first-year college students. These participants were selected from a group of 15 students who responded to the screener survey.

**Location and Setup**

The evaluation sessions were conducted remotely over Zoom. Each testing session included the participant, a moderator, an observer, and a technologist, as shown in the figure above. Details of the testing session agenda are presented in this testing packet.

The testing was conducted remotely, as depicted in the figure above. Each testing session included the participant, a moderator, an observer, and a technologist. The moderator was responsible for conducting the test and communicating with the participant. The observer recorded answers and took notes. The technologist handled screen recording and granted participants remote control of a browser displayed on one of our laptops, showcasing the RIT website.

**Recommendations and Future Work**

Despite the overall SUS score for the website being 80.42, surpassing the industry benchmark by 0.42 points, we identified a need to improve the visibility of relevant links within user flows. For example, information about the application process and deadlines should be more prominent and easily accessible.

It is recommended to perform a usability evaluation of the website on mobile devices, considering the navigation habits of Gen Z and younger generations.
