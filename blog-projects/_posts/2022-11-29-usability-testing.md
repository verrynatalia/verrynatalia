#### **Our Motivation**

This usability evaluation was part of the Usability Testing class taught by Mr. Chuck Schneider in the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the Spring of 2022. Each group of five students worked for a client on a heuristic evaluation and usability testing of a system.

Our client was the Division of Marketing and Communication at RIT. They wanted to test the usability of RIT’s main website. After the project kickoff, we had regular communications with the client to communicate progress on the milestones shown in the figure above.

#### **Goals and Research Questions**

The main goal of the usability testing was to evaluate the overall user experience of the website, especially with respect to prospective college students. They wanted to identify pain points, get feedback from prospective students on wayfinding, and identify areas for improvement. The study aimed to explore the following research questions:

1. Can the participant complete each task we assign them during the testing session?
2. How easily can the participant perform the tasks, and how satisfied are they after completing each task?
3. Do users navigate the site using the search function or the navigation bar to find information?

#### **Test Design and Participants**

The audience we focused on in this usability testing was prospective college students. Initially, the client wanted to include graduate and undergraduate prospective students in the study; however, we narrowed it down to prospective undergraduate students because it would allow us to define better testing tasks.

Initially, we wanted to work with high-school students, but due to challenges with recruiting and parental permissions, we decided to include first-year college students as surrogate participants.

The study is an exploratory test to discover any usability issues with the website that might be affecting prospective college students. We were able to work with six participants, one high-school senior student, and five first-year college students. These participants were selected from 15 students who responded to the screener survey.

<!--- **Test Design Summary**
- **Location:** Remote
- **Single group:** 6 participants
- **Tasks:** (1) Find a degree page, (2) find a specific page, (3) find a specific campus club, (4) book a campus on a specific date and time, (5) book appointment with admissions counselor.
- **Measures per task:** time on task, mouse clicks, success rate (e.g. participant lands on a specific information page.) and think aloud comments. 
- **Measures post task:** Level of satisfaction (likert scale) and perceived ease of use (likert scale). 
- **Measures post test:** SUS score and online habits preferences (six multiple choice questions). -->

#### **Location and Setup**

The testing was made remotely, as shown in the figure above; the participant, a moderator, an observer, and a technologist were present in each testing session. The moderator was in charge of conducting and communicating with the participant. The Observer was responsible for recording answers and taking notes. The technologist was responsible for screen recording and granting participants with remote control of a browser displaying the RIT website on one of our laptops.

#### **Tasks, Scenarios and Success Criteria**

| Task | Scenario | Success criteria |
| --- |
| 1. Find the Mechanical Engineering BS degree page. | Scenario: Have you had experience in operating machines? Imagine you are a high school senior with a passion for race cars and physics. You even spent time helping a friend of your father's at their auto repair shop last summer. It is your dream to one day work as a mechanical engineer for a company like Toyota. You have heard RIT offers a mechanical engineering degree, but you are not sure what classes are needed to fulfill the degree requirements, so you head to rit.edu to find out more. | The participant lands on the Mechanical Engineering webpage. |
| 2. Find the Cooperative Education and Internships page on the RIT website. | Do you have experience in cooperative education? Imagine an admissions counselor told you that all undergraduate engineering programs require at least one co-op. You never heard of a co-op before. So you head to rit.edu to find out more. | The participant lands on the Engineering Co-op webpage. |
| 3. Find and identify the Electronic Gaming Society (EGS) club on the RIT campus groups page. | What games have you played? Imagine you enjoy playing Minecraft on Xbox with your friends at home, where you grew up. You hope to find a similar group of friends if you attend RIT. You want to confirm a specific club on campus that shares the same interests as you, so you head to rit.edu. | The participant verbally tells the moderator the club's name Electronic Gaming Society while on the campus group's webpage. |
| 4. Book a campus tour for December 27, 2022, starting at 11 am on RIT's campus. | What was the last tour you went on? Imagine over your winter break. Your parents have scheduled a trip to visit western New York so you can see surrounding colleges. During this trip, you want the first stop to be RIT, so you head to rit.edu to schedule a guided tour for December 27. | The participant filled in the complete form for the Undergraduate Campus Visit on December 27, 2022, at 11 am and pressed submit button. |
| 5. Book a virtual Q&A session with an admissions counselor. | Have you had virtual meetings with a counselor? After you visit the campus, you realize you still have questions about the admissions process. In an information session you attended, you remember the presenter said to speak with an admissions counselor virtually. So you head to rit.edu to find out how to schedule an appointment with an admissions counselor. | Arrive at the form that will allow users to book a virtual appointment with an admission counselor. |

#### **Results Per-task**

We recorded each session and found the following results:

| Task Number | Success rate | Avg. clicks | Errors | Header Nav. | Search bar |
| --- |
| 1 | 6/6 | 5.1 | 1 | 6 | 2 |
| 2 | 0/6 | 4.5 | 4 | 8 | 3 |
| 3 | 3/6 | 7.5 | 6 | 8 | 0 |
| 4 | 4/6 | 29.5 | 5 | 7 | 0 |
| 5 | 0/6 | 6.3 | 6 | 6 | 1 |

#### **Post-task and Post-test Results**

After each task, the moderator asked the participant two Likert-scale questions, in which we asked them to rate from 1 to 5 the ease of use and satisfaction.

| Task | Perceived ease of use (1-5) | Perceived satisfaction (1-5) |
| --- |
| 1 | Mean: 4.7, Median: 5, Stdev: 0.8 | Mean: 5, Median: 5, Stdev: 0 |
| 2 | Mean: 3.5, Median: 3.5, Stdev: 1.1 | Mean: 4.1, Median: 4.5, Stdev: 1.1 |
| 3 | Mean: 3.5, Median: 3.5, Stdev: 0.8 | Mean: 4.1, Median: 4.5, Stdev: 1.5 |
| 4 | Mean: 4, Median: 4.5, Stdev: 1.5 | Mean: 4.3, Median: 5, Stdev: 1.2 |
| 5 | Mean: 3.3, Median: 4, Stdev: 1.4 | Mean: 4.1, Median: 4, Stdev: 0.7 |

After completing all tasks, the moderator asks each participant to complete a 10-question SUS questionnaire and two multiple-choice questions about internet habits. The moderator also asked open-ended questions about their overall experience using the website and allowed participants to share thoughts and questions about the website or the study. Below are some takeaways from the post-test questionnaire.

- Eighty-three percent of participants consider the content on the website helpful.
- University/College websites and their social media accounts are the main sources of information.
- Participants use both laptops and smartphones to find information online. While only one participant uses a tablet, and none use desktops.
- The overall RIT.edu SUS score is 80.42, which is 0.42 points above the industry benchmark.

#### **Recommendations and Future Work**

The usability testing results indicate a need to increase the visibility of important links within user flows. Change or update how prospective students find clubs and organizations.

Testing with more participants would cast more robust results, especially in the SUS score. Additionally, a future test of the desktop/laptop and mobile versions of the RIT website is recommended, given the internet habits of young people.
