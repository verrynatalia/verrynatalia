This evaluation was part of the project-based Usability Testing class taught by Mr. Chuck Schneider in the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). It was a group assignment that we completed during the course of the semester. Each group, composed of five students, was assigned a client.

My group worked with RIT’s Web Services Office. We worked alongside the client in the design, implementation, and report of a usability evaluation of the RIT main website. The primary goal of this evaluation was to assess the ease of use and effectiveness of the current site for prospective college students.

![RIT Usability Testing Highlights phases start with project kickoff, then heuristic evaluation, test plan, participating recruiting, usability testing, and ends with oral presentation and final report. For an overview of each phase, continue listening, or skip to continue. Starts with week 1, project kickoff: the testing team and client discussed the project goals, scope, and timeline. Heuristic Evaluation: a contextual inquiry with direct observation and competing products and websites of similar colleges in the Rochester area was performed by the usability team. Afterward, we worked on the heuristic evaluation of the RIT website. This resulted in a list of usability findings. Test Plan: we developed a test plan based on past milestones, allowing us to better define the project's goals and scope. The client approved the research questions and test methodology, including the participant's characteristics. Participant recruiting: we distributed digital and print communication materials on campus and among classmates. Persons interested in participating had to answer a screener questionnaire to help with the participant selection process. On week 10, Usability testing. The usability team conducted remote usability tests with six participants over two weeks. We ensured qualitative and quantitative data collection methods in all sessions and administered pre-test, post-task, and post-test questionnaires. On week 12, the oral presentation and final report: the data collected were organized and analyzed to present the results and conclusions in an oral presentation to the client.](https://github.com/verrynatalia/verrynatalia/blob/e0d83764406895d90b48ff617763f3b96022b198/assets/images/RIT_timeline.png)
