This evaluation was part of the project-based Usability Testing class taught by Mr. Chuck Schneider in the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). It was a group assignment that we completed as we progressed in the semester. Each group, composed of five students, was assigned a client.

My group worked with RIT’s Web Services Office. We worked along side the client in the design, implementation, and report of an usability evaluation of their main website. The primary goal of this evaluation was to assess the ease of use and effectiveness of the current site for prospective college students.

**Overview of activities and outputs**

- Kick-off meeting with the client to define the project scope and timeline.
- Performed a heuristic evaluation of the website and created a report to present the results to the client.
- Developed test plan and testing packet in consultation with the client.
- Recruited participants for the test.
- Performed a mockup test to tuned-up the testing environment and materials.
- Conducted usability tests with participants. This included data collection and questionnaires.
- Delivered and presented a final report with the results and recommendations for design changes.
