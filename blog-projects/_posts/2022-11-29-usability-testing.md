The usability evaluation of the RIT main website was part of the project-based Usability Testing class taught by Mr. Chuck Schneider in the Master's in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). It was a group assignment that we completed during the semester. Each group, composed of five students, was assigned a client. We worked with RIT's Division of Marketing and Communication.

After significant updates, the client, RIT's Division of Marketing and Communication, requested a usability test of the main RIT website. The usability testing team conducted a heuristic evaluation to inform their plan before conducting usability tests. The testing included 6 participants and five tasks. Participants had varying levels of success when completing each of the tasks. But feedback from participants based on ease of use and satisfaction was positive. The findings suggest users will be challenged to complete some tasks but can find alternative solutions or content that satisfies their needs.

The RIT website is a primary source of information used by prospective students and their families when considering which colleges to apply to. Therefore, the client's interest is ensuring the best user experience for RIt website visitors.

#### Goals and research questions

The main goal of the usability testing was to evaluate the overall user experience, specifically identify pain points, feedback from prospective students, wayfinding, and seeking out potential updates to usability. To that end we defined the following research questions:

1. Can the participant complete each task we assign them during the testing session?
2. How easily can the participant perform the tasks, and how satisfied are they after completing each task?
3. Do users navigate the site using the search function or the navigation bar to find information?

#### Test Design

- We conducted exploratory testing to discover usability issues. 
- Single group: 6 participants perform 5 tasks
- Measures taken per task, post task and post test
    - Per task: time on task, mouse clicks, success rate (e.g. participant lands on a specific information page.) and think aloud comments.
    - Post task: Level of satisfaction (likert scale) and perceived ease of use (likert scale).
    - Post test: SUS score and online habits preferences (six multiple choice questions).

#### Participants

We selected six participants from the 15 students who responded to the recruitment flyer. Given the challenges of recruiting prospect college students we decided to work with fresh-man students as surrogate participants. We have one High School senior and five 1st year college students.

#### Location and setup

The testing was made remotely with each participant. As shown in the diagram below, in each testing session a moderator, observer and technologist were present. The moderator was in charge of conduting and communicating with the participant. The Observer was responsible for recording answers and taking notes and the technologist was responsible for granting remote control to an Internet browser in our laptop.

#### Tasks, Scenarios and Success Criteria

| Task | Scenario | Success criteria |
| --- |
| **Task 1:** Find the Mechanical Engineering BS degree page. | Scenario: Have you had experiences in operating machines? Imagine you are a high school senior with a passion for race cars and physics. You even spent time helping a friend of your father’s at their auto repair shop last summer. It is your dream to one day work as a mechanical engineer for a company like Toyota. You have heard RIT offers a mechanical engineering degree, but you are not sure what classes are needed to fulfill the degree requirements, so you head to rit.edu to find out more. | The participant lands on the Mechanical Engineering webpage. |
| **Task 2:** Find the Cooperative Education and Internships page on the RIT website. | Do you have experience in cooperative education? Imagine an admissions counselor told you that all engineering undergraduate programs require at least one co-op. You never heard of a co-op before. So you head to rit.edu to find out more. | The participant lands on the Engineering Co-op webpage. |
| **Task 3:** Find and identify the Electronic Gaming Society (EGS) club on the RIT campus groups page. | What games have you played? Imagine you enjoy playing Minecraft on Xbox with your friends at home, where you grew up. You hope to find a similar group of friends if you attend RIT. You want to confirm a specific club on campus that shares the same interests as you, so you head to rit.edu. | The participant verbally tells the moderator the club’s name Electronic Gaming Society while on the campus groups webpage. |
| **Task 4:** Book a campus tour for December 27, 2022 starting at 11am on RIT’s campus. | What was the last tour you went on? Imagine over your winter break. Your parents have scheduled a trip to visit western New York so you can see surrounding colleges. During this trip, you want the first stop to be RIT, so you head to rit.edu to schedule a guided tour for December 27th. | The participant filled in the entire form of Undergraduate Campus Visit for December 27th, 2022, at 11 am, and press submit button. |
| **Task 5:** Book a virtual Q&A session with an admissions counselor. | Have you had virtual meetings with a counselor? After you visit the campus, you realize you still have questions about the admissions process. In an information session you attended, you remember the presenter said to speak with an admissions counselor virtually. So you head to rit.edu to find out how to schedule an appointment with an admissions counselor. | Arrive at the form that will allow users to book a virtual appointment with an admission counselor. |

#### Limitations and Review
- Not all participants are prospective undergraduate students.
- Deviation from original plan to include counter balancing for learning effects.
- We only test on the desktop version of the RIT website.
- Some surrogate participants are experienced users of the RIT website.
- Small sample size limits generalizability and conclusiveness of SUS score.
- This study does not include evaluation of the “application” and “tuition and fees” sections in the study.
- Challenges conducting testing remotely versus in-person controlled testing.
- The scenarios could be further refined for clarification.

#### Suggestions and Future Research

#### Recommendations
- Increase the visibility of important links within user flows.
- Change or update how prospective students find clubs and organizations.
- Discuss and review content based on user flows.

#### Future work
- Qualitative findings of this test can guide future tests
- Recommend testing the website on mobile devices
- A/B testing on laptop/desktop vs smartphones
