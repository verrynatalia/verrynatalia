#### **Our Motivation**

This usability evaluation was part of the Usability Testing class taught by Mr. Chuck Schneider in the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the spring of 2022. Each group of five students worked for a client on a heuristic evaluation and usability testing of a system.

Our client was the Division of Marketing and Communication at RIT. They wanted to test the usability of RIT’s main website. After the project kickoff, we had regular communications with the client to update them on the progress made on the milestones shown in the figure above.

#### **Goals and Research Questions**

The primary objective of the usability testing was to assess the overall user experience of the website, particularly from the perspective of prospective college students. The intention was to identify pain points, gather feedback from prospective students on wayfinding, and pinpoint areas that require improvement. The study aimed to investigate the following research questions:

1. Can the participants successfully complete the tasks assigned to them during the testing session?
2. How easily can participants perform the tasks, and how satisfied are they upon completion of each task?
3. Do users navigate the site using the search function or the navigation bar to find information?

#### **Test Design and Participants**

The target audience for this usability testing was prospective college students. Initially, the client intended to include both graduate and undergraduate prospective students in the study; however, we opted to focus solely on prospective undergraduate students to ensure more defined testing tasks.

Originally, we planned to involve high school students. However, due to challenges in recruitment and obtaining parental permissions, we decided to include first-year college students as surrogate participants instead.

The study serves as an exploratory test to identify any usability issues on the website that may impact prospective college students. We worked with a total of six participants, including one high school senior student and five first-year college students serving as surrogate participants. These participants were selected from a pool of 15 students who responded to the screener survey.

<!--- **Test Design Summary**
- **Location:** Remote
- **Single group:** 6 participants
- **Tasks:** (1) Find a degree page, (2) find a specific page, (3) find a specific campus club, (4) book a campus on a specific date and time, (5) book appointment with admissions counselor.
- **Measures per task:** time on task, mouse clicks, success rate (e.g. participant lands on a specific information page.) and think aloud comments. 
- **Measures post task:** Level of satisfaction (likert scale) and perceived ease of use (likert scale). 
- **Measures post test:** SUS score and online habits preferences (six multiple choice questions). -->

The testing was conducted remotely, as depicted in the figure above. Each testing session included the participant, a moderator, an observer, and a technologist. The moderator was responsible for conducting the test and communicating with the participant. The observer recorded answers and took notes. The technologist handled screen recording and granted participants remote control of a browser displayed on one of our laptops, showcasing the RIT website.

#### **Tasks, Scenarios and Success Criteria**

| Task | Scenario | Success criteria |
| --- |
| 1. Find the Mechanical Engineering BS degree page. | Scenario: Have you had experience in operating machines? Imagine you are a high school senior with a passion for race cars and physics. You even spent time helping a friend of your father's at their auto repair shop last summer. It is your dream to one day work as a mechanical engineer for a company like Toyota. You have heard RIT offers a mechanical engineering degree, but you are not sure what classes are needed to fulfill the degree requirements, so you head to rit.edu to find out more. | The participant lands on the Mechanical Engineering webpage. |
| 2. Find the Cooperative Education and Internships page on the RIT website. | Do you have experience in cooperative education? Imagine an admissions counselor told you that all undergraduate engineering programs require at least one co-op. You never heard of a co-op before. So you head to rit.edu to find out more. | The participant lands on the Engineering Co-op webpage. |
| 3. Find and identify the Electronic Gaming Society (EGS) club on the RIT campus groups page. | What games have you played? Imagine you enjoy playing Minecraft on Xbox with your friends at home, where you grew up. You hope to find a similar group of friends if you attend RIT. You want to confirm a specific club on campus that shares the same interests as you, so you head to rit.edu. | The participant verbally tells the moderator the club's name Electronic Gaming Society while on the campus group's webpage. |
| 4. Book a campus tour for December 27, 2022, starting at 11 am on RIT's campus. | What was the last tour you went on? Imagine over your winter break. Your parents have scheduled a trip to visit western New York so you can see surrounding colleges. During this trip, you want the first stop to be RIT, so you head to rit.edu to schedule a guided tour for December 27. | The participant filled in the complete form for the Undergraduate Campus Visit on December 27, 2022, at 11 am and pressed submit button. |
| 5. Book a virtual Q&A session with an admissions counselor. | Have you had virtual meetings with a counselor? After you visit the campus, you realize you still have questions about the admissions process. In an information session you attended, you remember the presenter said to speak with an admissions counselor virtually. So you head to rit.edu to find out how to schedule an appointment with an admissions counselor. | Arrive at the form that will allow users to book a virtual appointment with an admission counselor. |

#### **Results Per-task**

We recorded each session and obtained the following results:

| Task Number | Success rate | Avg. clicks | Errors | Header Nav. | Search bar |
| --- |
| 1 | 6/6 | 5.1 | 1 | 6 | 2 |
| 2 | 0/6 | 4.5 | 4 | 8 | 3 |
| 3 | 3/6 | 7.5 | 6 | 8 | 0 |
| 4 | 4/6 | 29.5 | 5 | 7 | 0 |
| 5 | 0/6 | 6.3 | 6 | 6 | 1 |

#### **Post-task and Post-test Results**

After each task, the moderator asked the participant two Likert-scale questions, in which we requested them to rate the ease of use and satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 5.

| Task | Perceived ease of use (1-5) | Perceived satisfaction (1-5) |
| --- |
| 1 | Mean: 4.7, Median: 5, Stdev: 0.8 | Mean: 5, Median: 5, Stdev: 0 |
| 2 | Mean: 3.5, Median: 3.5, Stdev: 1.1 | Mean: 4.1, Median: 4.5, Stdev: 1.1 |
| 3 | Mean: 3.5, Median: 3.5, Stdev: 0.8 | Mean: 4.1, Median: 4.5, Stdev: 1.5 |
| 4 | Mean: 4, Median: 4.5, Stdev: 1.5 | Mean: 4.3, Median: 5, Stdev: 1.2 |
| 5 | Mean: 3.3, Median: 4, Stdev: 1.4 | Mean: 4.1, Median: 4, Stdev: 0.7 |

After completing all tasks, the moderator asks each participant to complete a 10-question SUS questionnaire and two multiple-choice questions regarding their internet habits. Additionally, the moderator asked open-ended questions to gather feedback on the participants' overall experience using the website, allowing them to share their thoughts and raise any questions related to the website or the study. The post-test questionnaire provided the following key insights:

- Eighty-three percent of participants found the content on the website helpful.
- University/College websites and their social media accounts were identified as the primary sources of information.
- Participants utilized both laptops and smartphones as their main devices for finding information online in the past year. Only one participant used a tablet, and none used desktops.
- The overall SUS score for RIT.edu is 80.42, which surpasses the industry benchmark by 0.42 points.

#### **Recommendations and Future Work**

The usability testing results highlight the need to enhance the visibility of crucial links within user flows. There is a recommendation to consider changing or updating the process by which prospective students access information about clubs and organizations.

To achieve more robust results, conducting testing with a larger number of participants is advisable, particularly for evaluating the SUS score. Furthermore, it is recommended to conduct future tests that specifically focus on the desktop/laptop and mobile versions of the RIT website, considering the internet habits of young individuals.
