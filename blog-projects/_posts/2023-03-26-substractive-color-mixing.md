This tutorial was a class assignment for the Interactive Courseware class taught by Mrs. Katie Sabourin in the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the Spring of 2023. The assignment was to create an interactive tutorial that teaches a principle at the “use level” using a discovery approach that uses inductive thinking to go from the particular instances to the generality.

In this module on [Subtractive Color Mixing](https://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=c073458f-808f-4d74-955f-40bde57c4a32), the text on screen and audio uses first-person pronouns to help learners feel more engaged with the content. It also creates a sense of a social experience. At the beginning of the module, the narrator introduces herself and invites the learner to start the course.

 Within each page, the content is presented in small chunks of information with two or three concepts and relations covered at a time. I used the continue button as a divider to create the 'chunks' and to allow the user to control the pace of the module. Additionally, after the introduction and learning objectives are presented, I offer a pre-training section where the learner can find information relevant to color vision, which is the overarching topic of subtracting color mixing. The module uses an inductive reasoning approach. First, the learner is presented with a series of 'experiments,' and s/he is asked to provide the correct answer. Each correct and wrong answer provides immediate feedback to help the learner with their reasoning process. After the learner has tried to answer all questions, a description of the concepts and principles is provided. This should help the learner solidify or clarify the subtractive color mixing model.
