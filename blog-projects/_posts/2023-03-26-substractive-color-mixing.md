The tutorial on [Subtractive Color Mixing](https://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=c073458f-808f-4d74-955f-40bde57c4a32) was created for the Interactive Courseware class in the Master of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the Spring of 2023. Its objective is to teach learners the principle of subtractive color mixing, enabling them to apply it in various scenarios to predict the resulting colors from different combinations of light and tint.

Learning the principle of subtractive color mixing requires a basic understanding of color vision, the visible light spectrum, and the human eye. Therefore, a pretraining session has been included at the beginning of the tutorial.

Once the pretraining is completed, the learner is presented with a series of multiple-choice formative exercises, where they are required to determine the resulting color from a given mix. The correct answers and theoretical explanations are then provided. The content progresses from specific instances to the principle of subtractive color mixing.

To create a social experience for the learner, a narrator introduces herself at the beginning of the lesson. The personalization principle is also applied by referring to the learner using first-person pronouns. These elements aim to enhance learner engagement with the content.

Each page presents content in small, digestible chunks of information, covering a maximum of two or three concepts and their relationships at a time. The 'continue' button is used to separate the content and allow the user to control the module's pace.
