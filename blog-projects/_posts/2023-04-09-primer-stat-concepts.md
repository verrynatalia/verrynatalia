This tutorial was a class assignment for the Interactive Courseware class taught by Mrs. Katie Sabourin in the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the Spring of 2023. The assignment was to create an interactive module that teaches a concept at the “use level”.

#### Motivation

In recent years, the Department of Human Services (DHS) in Allegheny County has implemented the Family Screening Tool (FST), a predictive risk model (PRM) used to assist hotline call screeners in assessing the risk of harm to a child. According to DHS, using tools like FST allows hotline call screeners to prioritize cases more efficiently and accurately.

Child protection hotlines in the County serve as a means for individuals to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect. These hotlines are typically operated by DHS and are available 24/7. Anyone who suspects that a child is being abused or neglected can call the hotline to make a report. The hotline operator will then gather information about the situation and use the Family Screening Tool (FST) to calculate a risk score, which aids in deciding whether the case requires further action.

Hotline call screeners are proficient in the traditional functions of their role, which include gathering information from callers and determining how to respond to reports of child abuse or neglect. However, with the adoption of the Family Screening Tool (FST), it has become increasingly important to upskill hotline call screeners in basic quantitative skills relevant to using AI-based decision support (ADS) tools.

An [ethical analysis](https://www.alleghenycountyanalytics.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ethical-Analysis-16-ACDHS-26_PredictiveRisk_Package_050119_FINAL-2.pdf) of the FST's design and implementation highlighted the need for providing appropriate training to hotline call screeners on the tool's limitations, such as the possibility of false positives/negatives, confidence scores and predictions, among other topics. Training in basic statistical concepts relevant to utilizing ADS tools can enable hotline call screeners to use tools like FST effectively and ethically.

Furthermore, the use of AI-based decision support (ADS) tools, such as FST, in child protection programs is relatively new. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance in their use. ADS tools aim to support decision-making processes by augmenting the information processing capacity of users. Being overly skeptical of FST outputs or relying too heavily on erroneous (false positives/negatives) or biased outputs is not a balanced use of the tool.

#### Tutorial Description

As mentioned earlier, the tutorial [PRM Tool: Dealing with False Positives and False Negatives](https://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=88faaa41-7350-409f-b1db-66a8a9b5a485) is a class assignment that teaches concepts at the "use level". To access the tutorial, you will need to provide your name and email address. It explains relevant aspects of the tool that must be considered by call screeners, emphasizing the presence of accuracy errors in predictive risk models. The tutorial also covers the concepts of false positives and false negatives and how to detect them when assessing the accuracy of a risk score.

The multimedia principle is applied by providing a diagram that explains the call screening process. It includes labeled icons and a brief text description of the process. The information is presented contiguously, making it easier for learners to connect the graphic with the description.

The use of visual elements is limited due to the nature of the topic. However, in all practice exercises and assessment activities, icons indicating correctness (check mark) or incorrectness (cross) are displayed contiguously with feedback messages to highlight the results.

The practice exercises and remedial activities aim to help learners achieve the following objectives:

- From memory, you will be able to explain the concepts of 'false positive' and 'false negative.'
	- Given a case, you will be able to label its PRM score as accurate, false positive, or false positive based on additional information available.

The tutorial [PRM Tool: Dealing with False Positives and False Negatives](https://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=88faaa41-7350-409f-b1db-66a8a9b5a485) is available for review on the cloud. To access the tutorial, you will need to provide your name and email address.|
