#### Motivation

The child protection hotline operated by the Department of Human Services (DHS) in Allegheny County processes reports of child abuse and neglect. The hotline is staffed by call screeners who gather information about the individuals involved in order to utilize a predictive risk model (PRM) for classifying the cases. There are three possible classifications: screen-out, field screen for more information, and screen-in for investigation.

Since call screeners may not be familiar with AI tools for decision-making, it is necessary to provide them with training in basic statistical concepts. An [ethical analysis](https://www.alleghenycountyanalytics.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ethical-Analysis-16-ACDHS-26_PredictiveRisk_Package_050119_FINAL-2.pdf) of the tool has emphasized the importance of offering appropriate training to call screeners regarding the limitations of the tool.

#### Tutorial Description

This tutorial is a speculative project created as part of the Interactive Courseware class in the Master in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the Spring of 2023. The tutorial aims to teach the concepts of accuracy error, false positives, and false negatives in the context of the tool. It includes practice exercises with instant feedback, remedial activities, and a graded quiz.
