The module is an speculative project in the Interactive Courseware class in the Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the Spring of 2023.

#### Introduction
The Department of Human Services (DHS) is a government agency that is responsible for
providing a range of social services to individuals and families in need. The department also offer programs to help individuals and families become self-sufficient, such as job training and education programs. Additionally, the department is responsible for protecting vulnerable individuals, such as children and the elderly, from abuse and neglect.

Child protection programs are a type of program run by DHS that are designed to protect children at risk of abuse or neglect. These programs typically involve investigating reports of abuse or neglect, providing support and services to families to help prevent abuse and neglect from occurring, and placing children in protective custody when necessary. The specific services offered by child protection programs may include counseling, parenting classes, and temporary foster care for children who have experienced abuse or neglect. The goal of these programs is to
keep children safe and to help families provide a safe and nurturing environment for their children.

Child protection hotlines in the County, are a way for individuals to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect. These hotlines are typically operated by DHS, and they are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Anyone who suspects that a child is being abused or neglected can call the hotline to make a report. The hotline operator will then gather information about the situation and use the Family Screening Tool (FST) to produce a risk score which will help with the decision of whether a case warrants a field screen or visit and whether there is a justification
for carrying out a formal investigation. The goal of the hotline is to provide an easy and quickly way for members of the public to alert the authorities when they suspect that a child is in danger.

In recent years DHS has implemented the FST, a predictive risk model to support decisionmaking of hotline operators on the necessary actions to take in the face of an alleged case of abuse or neglect. Predictive risk models (PRM) in child protection programs are mathematical models that are used to identify children who are at high risk of suffering harm, such as abuse or neglect. These models use data about the child and their family, such as their age, gender, history of family in the judicial system, homelessness, and the history of abuse or neglect in their family, to predict the likelihood that the child will suffer harm in the future. The goal of these models is to help child protection workers prioritize cases and intervene in situations where the risk is high, to protect the child from harm.
The FST, or Family Screening Tool, is a tool that helps hotline operators assess the risk level of a particular case. The tool uses information from the County Data Warehouse, a consolidated database of publicly funded human services data, to provide operators with a real-time risk assessment score. The operators can then use this score to classify the case as high-risk, mediumrisk or low-risk to determine the appropriate course of action.

After an alleged case of abuse and neglect is reported, the hotline operator will gather information and use the FST to produce a risk score for the case. By using data from a consolidated database, the FST can provide operators with a more comprehensive view of a case and help them make better-informed decisions. Based on the risk score, the operator may choose to:
1. Screen-out the allegation without any further evaluation or assessment (if there are no children aged 6 or younger in the household).
2. Conducting a field screen of the maltreatment allegation in order the evaluate the safety and well-being of the child and determine whether a formal investigation is warranted.
3. Conducting a formal investigation of the maltreatment allegation to determine if
maltreatment has occurred may result in placing children in protective custody and other necessary measures.
If the FST indicates that the case is high-risk, the hotline operator will likely recommend a formal investigation to assess the situation and determine if the child is safe. If the child happens to be in danger, the DHS worker may take steps to protect the child.
If the FST indicates that the case is low risk, the hotline operator may still recommend a visit from a DHS worker, but the visit may be more focused on providing support and services to the family rather than conducting a formal investigation. The goal in either case is to ensure the safety and well-being of the child.
Training for hotline operators who use the FST, or Family Screening Tool, is focused on helping them understand the policy and practice for using the tool. This training is important to ensure that operators can use the FST effectively, accurately, and ethically.

#### The learners

Child protection hotline operators are the primary audience for training on the ethical use of the FST, or Family Screening Tool. As the main users of the tool, it is important that hotline operators are aware of the policy and practice for using the tool. This training is important to ensure that operators can use the FST effectively, accurately, and ethically.
Hotline operators working in the DHS, or Department of Human Services, typically have a bachelor's degree in social work or a related field. They also typically have at least one year of experience working in child welfare, social services, behavioral health, or a related field.
In terms of technical skills, hotline operators are expected to be proficient in Word and have basic familiarity with Excel. These skills are important because operators may need to use Word to document the information they gather from callers, and they may need to use Excel to manage and analyze data related to the cases they handle.
Overall, the combination of education, experience, and technical skills that hotline operators have helps them to handle the cases effectively and efficiently they receive, and to provide the necessary support and services to children and families.

#### The need for this online learning

A recent ethical review of FST design and implementation identified the need for training on the ethical use of FST because using predictive risk models in child protection programs can raise ethical concerns. Generally, hotline operators don’t have any previous experience or knowledge of FST or PRM. This presses on the need for providing hotline operators with training on not only the policy and practice of using FST but also on the ethical use of the tool to ensure that the tool is used in a way that is fair, respectful, and responsible. This can help protect the rights and interests of children and families and ensure that the hotline is a valuable resource for those in need.
Child protection hotline operators are typically competent in the traditional functions of their role, such as gathering information from callers and determining how to respond to reports of child abuse or neglect. However, with the recent adoption of a data-driven approach and tools like the FST, or Family Screening Tool, it has become evident that operators may lack the knowledge and skills to use the tool effectively and ethically.
It's important for child protection hotline operators to have a thorough understanding of any tools or technology they use in their work. This includes understanding how predictive modeling tools like FST work and how to use them effectively to make decisions about how to classify alleged cases of neglect and abuse.
Rotation of hotline operators is high, which makes it even more important for DHS to provide comprehensive training on data-driven approaches and tools like FST. This is especially true if operators are hired on a temporary, part-time basis and may not have strong skills in quantitative reasoning. Comprehensive training can help to ensure that operators are able to use tools like AFST effectively and ethically and can help to improve outcomes for children and families. It's also important for DHS to provide ongoing support to ensure that operators can continue learning and developing their skills, even as they are rotated in and out of the hotline.
An instructional intervention focused on increasing buy-in and better use of FST among child protection hotline operators will include training on the basics of predictive risk modeling, policy, practice, and ethical use of the tool. This training will be a 20-hour online training. By providing comprehensive training, DHS can help to ensure that FST is used to its full potential to support the important work of child protection.

#### Terminal objective

Using FST and additional case information during a call, the learner will be able to operate FST to produce a risk score. Must be able to classify a case as high-risk, medium-risk or low-risk accurately and ethically based on analysis of risk score and case information. The learner should be able to state how elements of confirmation bias, stigmatization, and confidence errors in the accuracy of risk may have affected the classification results.

#### Motivation

The motivation for creating this especulative module is the 

This module is on implementing the FS tool to support decision-making processes in call screenings. The content explains relevant aspects of the tool that must be considered by call screeners, especially before overwriting FS scores.

The use of AI-based decision support (ADS) tools –such as FS tool– in child protection programs is fairly new. Thus, the importance of ensuring a balanced use, in other words, ADS's aim is to support decision-making processes by “augmenting” the information processing capacity of its users. Being too skeptical of useful FS outputs or too reliant upon erroneous (false positives/negatives) or harmful biased outputs is not a balanced use of the tool.

Sufficient practice exercises and a remedial activity aim to help learners achieve the following objectives:
- From memory, you will be able to explain the benefits and limitations of the Family Screening tool.
    - Given an FS score and additional context information, you will be able to identify elements of confirmation bias that may influence your confidence level in the accuracy of the score.

#### Explanation

This module is an improved version of the concept project. It is about accuracy errors in predictive risk models for child protection. It explains the concepts of false positive and false negatives and how to detect them when assessing the accuracy of a PRM score.
The multimedia principle was applied by providing a diagram that explains the call screening process. It includes icons with labels and a brief description of the process as text. The information is contiguous, so it is easier for the learner to connect the graphic with the description.
The use of visual elements is limited because of the nature of the topic. However, in all practices and assessment exercises icons to indicate correct (check mark) or incorrect (cross) are displayed contiguous to feedback messages to highlight the results.
Based on previous feedback I modified the learning objectives. The new learning objectives are:
From memory, you will be able to explain the concepts of 'false positive' and 'false negative.'
	•	Given a case, you will be able to label its PRM score as accurate, false positive, or false positive based on additional information available.
