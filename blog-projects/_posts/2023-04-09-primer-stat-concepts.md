The tutorial ['PRM Tool: Dealing with False Positives and False Negatives'](https://app.cloud.scorm.com/sc/InvitationConfirmEmail?publicInvitationId=88faaa41-7350-409f-b1db-66a8a9b5a485) was created for the Interactive Courseware class in the Master in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in the Spring of 2023. The tutorial aims to teach the concepts of accuracy error, false positives, and false negatives to call screeners who are required to utilize a predictive risk model to classify cases received through a child protection hotline. It includes practice exercises with instant feedback, remedial activities, and a graded quiz.

#### Motivation

The motivation for creating this tutorial was to explore how to train end-users of AI-powered tools for decision-making in social services. It is based on Allegheny County's child protection hotline program operated by the Department of Human Services (DHS). The child protection hotline is staffed by call screeners who gather information about the individuals involved to utilize a predictive risk model (PRM) for classifying the cases. Since using AI tools for decision-making is outside their traditional area of expertise, there is a need to teach concepts and practices that would enable them to use the model more effectively.
