I am a graduate student in Human-Computer Interaction at the [Rochester Institute of Technology][RIT], specializing in Instructional Systems Design (ISD). My focus is on creating online courses that enhance the learning experience of adult learners in both academic and professional contexts. 

I strive to employ evidence-based instructional techniques, appropriate media types and interactivity approaches in the design of new online courses.
